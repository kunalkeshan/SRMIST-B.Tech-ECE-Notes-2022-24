> **Warning**
> Semester 1 - 3 notes are based on **online classes**. Study material might be relevant but not the test notes. Take it with a grain of salt.

## Motivation

Before I switched to on-campus courses, I took all of my classes online and hardly interacted with any upperclassmen. Without assistance, it was difficult for me to locate relevant readings and organise my time effectively in order to succeed on my tests. Even if we moved our lessons to a more traditional format, we still wouldn't be able to get any understanding of how to make use of the materials we were given.

You'll hardly have any contact with your seniors until you're part of some club, working together on some project or a research paper. I've made this repo to support any person who requires the relavent study material present here.

> <q> This repo is my step towards being the senior I needed the most as a Junior. </q>
