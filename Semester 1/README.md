## How to Study?

### Calculus and Linear Algebra

- Solve with Teacher in the Class in the starting.
- Try and do question by yourself also in between, that way you'll have an idea of what to do before the exams even start.
- Use the Tutorial sheets that your professors share, that's more than enough to prepare for exams.

### Chemistry

- Take notes.
- Don't worry about stuff being too complicated, you'll be covering the same portions that you did in your senior school days.
- Some advanced topics for each unit is present.
- Revise Organic chemistry frequently, because you will forget it eventually. That stuff is volatile.

### Civil and Mechanical Workshop

- If you like making things, this is the place for you. The academics though, don't rely on it much.
- Don't stress out on this much, just understand how things are made.
- Be careful with working with Tools.

---

### Japanese

- One of the most fun classes I've personally experienced.
- It will seem tough and funny at the same time in the beginning.
- Just follow through the notes and best way to practice is by speaking things out yourself.
- Watch YouTube videos on the Language itself, see how things are pronounced and how to respond.

---

### Programming for Problem Solving

- Not the perfect course on programming, but hey, atleast you have an incentive to finish one.
- Focus on the basics first, learn how programming works before learning the syntax.
- Practice problems frequently in ELab and external websites as well to get a better hang of C.

#### Resources:

- Practice Questions at HackerRank: [https://www.hackerrank.com/](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- Video: [C Programming Tutorial for Beginners by FreeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/KJgsSFOSQv0)

- This class here if for you interact and speak up, so take the opportunity and do it.
